## Project Data Cleaning Approach Followed:
1. **Data Understanding:**  
   The key to success on any data project is to understand the data in detail. So we took the time to understand the data model and the domain of your business.
   
2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   After understanding your business, we then cleaned the available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for this problem.
   
3. **Data Modelling:**  
   After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, we processed and modeled this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the business questions and produce the results needed.
   
4. **Data Analysis:**  
   With our new dataset, we used our analytical expertise to uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the insights.
   
5. **Business Decisions:**  
   Finally, we used these insights to unlock business decisions and make recommendations on the next steps.

## Analysis
Animals and science are the two most popular categories of content, showing that people enjoy "real-life" and "factual" content the most.

## Insight
Food is a common theme with the top 5 categories, with "Healthy Eating" ranking the highest. This may give an indication of the audience within your user base. You could use this insight to create a campaign and work with healthy eating brands to boost user engagement
